\section*{Preface}

Probability theory is a fundamental branch of mathematics 
with applications in numerous fields, 
including statistics, computer science, physics, and engineering. 
While the subject has many practical applications, 
it is also a beautiful and elegant area of mathematics in its own right. 
This book is designed to offer readers a thorough 
and rigorous understanding of the concepts 
and principles that underlie probability theory.

To that end, this book begins with a detailed treatment of measure theory, 
which provides the mathematical framework for probability theory. 
I mainly refer to \cite{taylorIntroductionMeasureIntegration1973}
for this part.
From there, the book explores the concepts of random variables
and distribution functions, and their properties.

\section{Classes of Sets}

%------------------------------

\begin{definition} \label{def:1}
	A collection of subsets of $\Omega$, $\mathcal{S}$, 
	is a \textbf{semi-algebra}\index{semi-algebra}
	if it satisfies the following properties:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $\Omega \in \mathcal{S}$
		\item $A, B \in \mathcal{S} \implies A \cap B \in \mathcal{S}$
		\item The complement of every set in $\mathcal{S}$ can be 
			written as a finite disjoint union 
			of sets in $\mathcal{S}$. 
			Formally, $\forall A \in \mathcal{S}, \; \exists E_1, \ldots, E_n \in \mathcal{S}$
			such that $A^\complement = \biguplus_{i=1}^n E_i$
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{example} \label{eg:1}
	Let $\Omega = \R$.
	Suppose $\mathcal{S}$ is a collection of subsets in $\R$
	consisting of intervals of the following forms:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $(a, b]$
		\item $(-\infty, b]$
		\item $(a, \infty)$
		\item $(-\infty, \infty) = \R$
	\end{enumerate}
	One may check that $\mathcal{S}$ is indeed a semi-algebra by definition.
	And it is by studying this type of collection of sets that
	the definition of semi-algebra arises.
\end{example}

%------------------------------

\begin{definition} \label{def:2}
	A collection of subsets of $\Omega$, $\mathcal{A}$,
	is called an \textbf{algebra}\index{algebra} if
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $\Omega \in \mathcal{A}$
		\item $A, B \in \mathcal{A} \implies A \cap B \in \mathcal{A}$
		\item $A \in \mathcal{A} \implies A^\complement \in \mathcal{A}$
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

%------------------------------

\begin{proposition} \label{pro:1}
	Let $\{\mathcal{A}_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in \Lambda}$ 
	be a collection of algebras in $\Omega$
	where $\Lambda$ is any index set,
	then 
	\begin{align*}
		\bigcap_{\alpha \in \Lambda} \mathcal{A}_{\alpha}
	\end{align*}
	is also an algebra.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	% TODO
\end{proof}

%------------------------------

\begin{definition} \label{def:3}
	A collection of subsets of $\Omega$, $\mathcal{F}$,
	is called a \textbf{$\sigma$-algebra}\index{$\sigma$-algebra} if
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $\Omega \in \mathcal{F}$
		\item $\mathcal{F}$ is closed under countable intersections, 
			i.e,. $A_n \in \mathcal{F} \; \forall n \in \N^\ast \implies \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty A_n \in \mathcal{F}$
		\item $A \in \mathcal{F} \implies A^\complement \in \mathcal{F}$
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

Of course, a $\sigma$-algebra is also closed under finite intersections 
(and unions)
since we can always write
\begin{align*}
	\bigcap_{n=1}^m A_n
	= \bigcap_{n=1}^m A_n \cap \bigcap_{n=m+1}^\infty \Omega
	= \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty A_n
	\quad \text{where $A_n = \Omega$ for $n \geq m+1$}
\end{align*}
Therefore, the $\sigma$-algebra is of course an algebra.

Analogous to Proposition~\ref{pro:1}, any intersections of $\sigma$-algebras
is also itself a $\sigma$-algebra.

\begin{proposition} \label{pro:2}
	Let $\{\mathcal{F}_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in \Lambda}$ 
	be a collection of $\sigma$-algebras in $\Omega$
	where $\Lambda$ is any index set,
	then 
	\begin{align*}
		\bigcap_{\alpha \in \Lambda} \mathcal{F}_{\alpha}
	\end{align*}
	is also a $\sigma$-algebra.
\end{proposition}

%------------------------------

Having proved Proposition~\ref{pro:1} and Proposition~\ref{pro:2},
we may introduce the algebra and $\sigma$-algebra
generated by a class of subsets in $\Omega$.

\begin{definition} \label{def:4}
	Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a class of subsets in $\Omega$.
	The \textbf{algebra generated by $\mathcal{C}$}\index{algebra generated by class of sets}, 
	is defined by 
	\begin{align*}
		\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{C})
		:= \bigcap_{
			\text{$\mathcal{A}$ is an algebra, }\mathcal{A} 
			\supseteq \mathcal{C}
		} \mathcal{A} 
	\end{align*}
	That is, it is the intersection of all algebras 
	containing $\mathcal{C}$.
	Similarly, the \textbf{$\sigma$-algebra generated by $\mathcal{C}$}\index{$\sigma$-algebra generated by class of sets}
	is defined by 
	\begin{align*}
		\sigma(\mathcal{C})
		:= \bigcap_{
			\text{$\mathcal{F}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra, }\mathcal{F} 
			\supseteq \mathcal{C}
		} \mathcal{F}
	\end{align*}
\end{definition}

Note that the set
\begin{align*}
	\set{\mathcal{A} \subset \mathcal{P}(\Omega)}
	{\text{$\mathcal{A}$ is an algebra, }\mathcal{A} \supseteq \mathcal{C}}
\end{align*}
is clearly nonempty since the power set, $\mathcal{P}(\Omega)$, 
itself is one of its element.
And then by Proposition~\ref{pro:1}, $\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{C})$
is indeed well-defined, and so is $\sigma(\mathcal{C})$.

One important property for $\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{C})$ 
(resp. $\sigma(\mathcal{C})$) is that 
it is the \textit{smallest} algebra (resp. $\sigma$-algebra) 
containing $\mathcal{C}$, as stated in the following proposition.

\begin{proposition} \label{pro:3}
	Let $\mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(\Omega)$.
	We have the following:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item If $\mathcal{A}$ is an algebra containing $\mathcal{C}$,
			then $\mathcal{A} \supseteq \mathcal{A}(\mathcal{C})$.
		\item If $\mathcal{F}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra containing $\mathcal{C}$,
			then $\mathcal{F} \supseteq \sigma(\mathcal{C})$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

%------------------------------

As we see in Example~\ref{eg:1},
it is easy to describe the elements in a semi-algebra
directly in terms of subsets of $\Omega$.
However, it is difficult in general to describe 
the elements in an algebra,
and it is even more difficult to do the same 
for the $\sigma$-algebra.

It is because there is no explicit form of
describing a $\sigma$-algebra in terms of subsets in $\Omega$
that makes the extension of a measure (or any properties) from 
the semi-algebra to $\sigma$-algebra extremely difficult.
As we shall see in many proofs, 
we will exploit the property of a $\sigma$-algebra
in an \textit{inductive} way rather than a \textit{constructive} one.

Fortunately, we do have an explicit form for the algebra generated
by a semi-algebra $\mathcal{S}$, $\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{S})$,
in terms of sets in $\mathcal{S}$.
It turns out that it is simply the collection
of all finite disjoint unions of sets in $\mathcal{S}$.

\begin{theorem} \label{thm:2}
	Let $\mathcal{S}$ be a semi-algebra on $\Omega$.
	Then
	\begin{align}
		A \in \mathcal{A}(\mathcal{S})
		\iff \exists E_1, \ldots, E_n \in \mathcal{S}, \;
		A = \biguplus_{i=1}^n E_i
		\label{eq:1}
	\end{align}
\end{theorem}

\begin{note}
	Note that the integer $n$ in \eqref{eq:1} is not fixed.
	That is the choice of $n$ may vary for different set $A$.
\end{note}

\begin{proof}
	(Proof of $\impliedby$) The reverse direction of \eqref{eq:1}
	is easy to prove. 
	Suppose $A = \biguplus_{i=1}^n E_i$ where each $E_i \in \mathcal{S}$.
	Then clearly $A \in \mathcal{A}(\mathcal{S})$
	since the algebra is closed under finite unions.

	(Proof of $\implies$)
	The proof of the forward direction is more interesting.
	\begin{note}
		Note that given $A \in \mathcal{A}(\mathcal{S})$,
		it is tempting and yet difficult
		to find a representation of $A$
		as the right-hand side of \eqref{eq:1}.
		Hence, we shall prove this in an indirect way.
		Instead of finding a specific representation of $A$,
		we shall look at all representations described by \eqref{eq:1}.
		That is, we consider the collection, say $\mathcal{C}$, 
		of all finite disjoint unions of sets in $\mathcal{S}$.
		And then we show 
		that $\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{S}) \subseteq \mathcal{C}$.
	\end{note}
	\noindent Define 
	\begin{align*}
		\mathcal{C}
		= \set{E \subseteq \Omega}{
			\exists E_1, \ldots, E_n \in \mathcal{S}, \;
			E = \biguplus_{i=1}^n E_i
		}
	\end{align*}
	The goal is to show that this collection $\mathcal{C}$
	is actually an algebra containing $\mathcal{S}$.

	It is clear that $\mathcal{C} \supseteq \mathcal{S}$
	by the definition of $\mathcal{C}$.
	What remains to show is that $\mathcal{C}$
	is an algebra.
	We need to check whether it satisfies
	each of the three properties one after another.

	First, note that $\Omega \in \mathcal{C}$
	since $\Omega \in \mathcal{S}$ 
	and we have seen that $\mathcal{C} \supseteq \mathcal{S}$.

	Now, we show $\mathcal{C}$ is closed under intersections.
	Let $E, F \in \mathcal{C}$.
	By definition, $E$ and $F$ can be written as 
	\begin{align*}
		E = \biguplus_{i=1}^n E_i
		\quad \text{and} \quad 
		F = \biguplus_{j=1}^m F_j
	\end{align*}
	where $E_i, F_j \in \mathcal{S}$.
	It then follows that 
	\begin{align*}
		E \cap F
		= \biguplus_{i=1}^n \brk{
			E_i \cap \biguplus_{j=1}^m F_j
		}
		= \biguplus_{i=1}^n \biguplus_{j=1}^m \brk{E_i \cap F_j}
	\end{align*}
	Note that $E_i \cap F_j \in \mathcal{S}$.
	Hence, we have $E \cap F \in \mathcal{C}$
	since the above equation says $E \cap F$
	is a finite disjoint union of sets, $(E_i \cap F_j)$'s, 
	in $\mathcal{S}$.

	We also need to show $\mathcal{C}$ is closed under complements.
	Let $E \in \mathcal{C}$.
	The set $E$ can be written as 
	\begin{align*}
		E = \biguplus_{i=1}^n E_i
	\end{align*}
	where $E_i \in \mathcal{S}$.
	Then, the complement of $E$,
	\begin{align*}
		E^\complement = \bigcap_{i=1}^n E^\complement_i
	\end{align*}
	By the property of semi-algebra,
	each $E^\complement_i$ can be written as 
	\begin{align*}
		E^\complement_i = \biguplus_{j=1}^{m_i} F_{i,j}
	\end{align*}
	where $F_{i,j} \in \mathcal{S}$.
	Therefore, $E^\complement_i \in \mathcal{C}$ 
	by the definition of $\mathcal{C}$.
	And then $E^\complement \in \mathcal{C}$
	since we have already shown
	that $\mathcal{C}$ is closed under finite intersections.

	In summary, we have proved so far that $\mathcal{C}$
	is indeed an algebra containing $\mathcal{S}$.
	It then follows that $\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{S}) \subseteq \mathcal{C}$
	since $\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{S})$
	is the smallest algebra containing $\mathcal{S}$.
	Therefore, for each $A \in \mathcal{A}(\mathcal{S})$, $A$
	can always be written as a finite disjoint
	union of sets in $\mathcal{S}$
	by the definition of $\mathcal{C}$.
\end{proof}

\section{Set Functions}

%------------------------------

A \textbf{set function}\index{set function}
is a function defined on collection of sets
whose range is usually the union
of non-negative real numbers 
and the positive infinity, $\R_{\geq 0} \cup \{\infty\}$.

\begin{definition} \label{def:5}
	A set function, $\mu$, defined 
	on $\mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(\Omega)$ is said to 
	be \textbf{additive}
	or \textbf{finitely additive}\index{additive set function}
	if
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $\mu(\emptyset) = 0$, and
		\item $\mu \brk{ \biguplus_{i=1}^n A_i } = \sum_{i=1}^n \mu(A_i)$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

By the second condition in above definition, 
the natural class of sets to consider
is the algebra since we 
would want that the class is closed under finite unions of sets. 

\begin{note}
	The condition $\mu(\emptyset) = 0$
	is actually redundant in all cases except the one
	where $\mu(A) = \infty$ for all $A \in \mathcal{C}$.
	To see this, suppose that $\mu(A) < \infty$
	for some $A \in \mathcal{C}$.
	We have $A = A \uplus \emptyset$.
	It then follows from the second condition
	that $\mu(A) = \mu(A) + \mu(\emptyset)$,
	which further implies $\mu(\emptyset) = 0$
	since $\mu(A) < \infty$.
\end{note}

If $A \subseteq B$,
then it is natural to expect that $\mu(A) \leq \mu(B)$.
It is indeed the case.
But the proof is not completely trivial.
We can always write $B = A \uplus (B \setminus A)$.
Then, we have 
\begin{align*}
	\mu(B) = \mu(A) + \mu(B \setminus A)
	\geq \mu(A)
\end{align*}
Note that the above inequality holds
no matter whether $\mu(B \setminus A)$ is finite or not.

%------------------------------

\begin{definition} \label{def:6}
	A set function, $\mu$, 
	defined on $\mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(\Omega)$
	is said to be \textbf{$\sigma$-additive}\index{$\sigma$-additive set function}
	if
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $\mu(\emptyset) = 0$, and 
		\item $\mu\brk{ \biguplus_{n=1}^\infty A_n } = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \mu(A_n)$
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{example} \label{eg:2}
	Let $\Omega = (0, 1)$ and
	\begin{align*}
		\mathcal{C} = \set{(a, b]}{0 \leq a < b < 1}
	\end{align*}
	Consider the set function $\mu$ on $\mathcal{C}$ given by
	\begin{align*}
		\mu (a, b] = \begin{cases}
			\infty,
			&a = 0 \\
			b - a,
			&a > 0
		\end{cases}
	\end{align*}
	
	We claim that $\mu$ is additive on $\mathcal{C}$.
	Suppose that
	\begin{align*}
		(a, b]
		= \biguplus_{i=1}^n (a_i, b_i]
	\end{align*}
	There are two cases.

	(Case 1: $a = 0$) If $a = 0$, then $\mu (a, b] = \infty$.
	And there exists $i$ such that $a_i = 0$,
	which implies $\mu(a_i, b_i] = \infty$.
	In this case, we have 
	\begin{align*}
		\infty = \mu (a, b]
		= \sum_{i=1}^n \mu(a_i, b_i] = \infty
	\end{align*}

	(Case 2: $a > 0$) Without loss of generality,
	we may assume $a_i < a_{i+1}$ for all $i$.
	Then it is clear that $a_1 = a$, $b_n = b$, and
	\begin{align*}
		b_i = a_{i+1}
		\quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, n-1
	\end{align*}
	It follows that 
	\begin{align*}
		\sum_{i=1}^n \mu (a_i, b_i]
		= \sum_{i=1}^n b_i - a_1
		= b - a 
		= \mu (a, b]
	\end{align*}

	Therefore, we conclude that $\mu$ is indeed additive.
	However, $\mu$ is not $\sigma$-additive.
	To see this, we note that 
	\begin{align*}
		(0, \frac{1}{2}]
		= \biguplus_{i = 2}^\infty ( \frac{1}{i+1}, \frac{1}{i} ]
	\end{align*}
	We have 
	\begin{align*}
		\sum_{i=2}^\infty \mu(\frac{1}{i+1}, \frac{1}{i}]
		= \sum_{i=2}^\infty \brk{ -\frac{1}{i+1} + \frac{1}{i}}
		= \lim_{n \to \infty} \brk{ \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{n+1} }
		= \frac{1}{2}
	\end{align*}
	whereas
	\begin{align*}
		\mu (0, \frac{1}{2}] = \infty
	\end{align*}
	Therefore, $\mu$ is not $\sigma$-additive.
\end{example}

%------------------------------

\begin{definition} \label{def:7}
	Let $\mu$ be a set function
	defined on $\mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(\Omega)$.
	Then
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $\mu$ is said to 
			be \textbf{continuous from below}\index{continuity from below}
			at set $E \in \mathcal{C}$ if
			\begin{align*}
				E_n \in \mathcal{C}, \; E_n \uparrow E
				\implies
				\mu(E_n) \uparrow \mu(E)
			\end{align*}
		\item $\mu$ is said to 
			be \textbf{continuous from above}\index{continuity from above}
			at set $E \in \mathcal{C}$ if
			\begin{align*}
				E_n \in \mathcal{C}, \; E_n \downarrow E
				\quad \text{and} \quad
				\exists n_0 \in \N^\ast, \;
				\mu(E_{n_{0}}) < \infty
				\implies
				\mu(E_n) \downarrow \mu(E)
			\end{align*}
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

The symbol $E_n \uparrow E$ means that
\begin{align*}
	E_n \subseteq E_{n+1} 
	\quad \forall n \in \N^\ast
	\quad \text{and} \quad
	\bigcup_{n = 1}^\infty E_n = E
\end{align*}
And by writing $\mu(E_n) \uparrow \mu(E)$,
we mean that 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $\{\mu(E_n)\}$ is an increasing sequence 
		(of extended real numbers), and 
	\item $\lim_{n \to \infty} \mu(E_n) = \mu(E)$.
\end{enumerate}
In fact, in the above definition, we only need to assume 
the limit of $\mu(E_n)$ is $\mu(E)$
since we have already noticed that 
\begin{align*}
	A \subseteq B  \implies \mu(A) \leq \mu(B)
\end{align*}

Now, we pay attention to the condition in the second statement
of the above definition, i.e., 
the definition of the continuity from above.
Note that comparing to the continuity from below, 
we impose an additional requirement that $\mu(E_{n_0})$ is finite
for some index $n_0$.
The reason why we do this is explained through the following example.

\begin{example} \label{eg:3}
	Let $\Omega = \R$ and $E_n = [n, \infty)$.
	We would want the length of $E_n$, $\lambda(E_n)$,
	to be infinity.
	Actually, $\lambda$ is a measure, called Lebesgue measure, 
	on the Borel $\sigma$-algebra of the real line,
	which is a generalization of the concept of length.

	Note that $E_n \downarrow \emptyset$.
	We have $\lambda(E_n) = \infty$ whereas $\lambda(\emptyset) = 0$.
	In this case, $\lambda(E_n)$ does not tend to $\lambda(\emptyset)$
	as $n \to \infty$.
	If we do not assume $\lambda(E_n)$ is finite for some $n = n_0$,
	then we cannot say $\lambda$ is continuous from above at $\emptyset$
	in this case.
	However, we really want that the measure to be continuous from above
	at all sets.
	Therefore, it is necessary to impose an additional condition
	as in Definition~\ref{def:7}.
\end{example}
