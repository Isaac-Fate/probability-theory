# Preface

Probability theory is a fundamental branch of mathematics
with applications in numerous fields,
including statistics, computer science, physics, and engineering.
While the subject has many practical applications,
it is also a beautiful and elegant area of mathematics in its own right.
This book is designed to offer readers a thorough
and rigorous understanding of the concepts
and principles that underlie probability theory.

To that end, this book begins with a detailed treatment of measure theory,
which provides the mathematical framework for probability theory.
I mainly refer to {cite}`taylorIntroductionMeasureIntegration1973`
for this part.
From there, the book explores the concepts of random variables
and distribution functions, and their properties.
